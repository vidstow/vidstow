# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to VidStow are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versions follow semantic versioning where practical for a desktop
application.

`v0.1.0-beta.1` is the first public VidStow prerelease. The current packaged
preview is `v0.1.0-beta.5` for macOS Apple Silicon; a later stable `0.1.0`
does not exist yet.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Explicit macOS browser-session access for individual YouTube videos, Shorts,
  and existing playlists using backend-discovered Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
  profiles. Public-only access remains the default, consent is required, and
  cookie values are never persisted by VidStow.
- Authenticated playlist review with visible per-occurrence Ready, Auth required,
  Unavailable, and Invalid outcomes, stable source ordering, atomic admission of
  selected Ready children, exact parent counts, and durable source binding.

### Changed

- Packaged macOS builds include the ytdlp-go and JavaScript-runtime license
  notices used by the bundled helper.

### Fixed

- Browser-session analysis allows a bounded five-minute owner-interaction
  window for macOS permission prompts and reports delayed approval as a browser
  access timeout rather than an unsupported URL.
- Authenticated playlists that expose more than 500 occurrences are rejected
  visibly instead of presenting a silently truncated review.
- Updated reachable Unicode normalization code to the patched
  `golang.org/x/text` release.
- Action-required downloads can be dismissed from the queue without retrying
  or deleting their preserved temporary data. Rows with pending cleanup remain
  visible until that cleanup settles.

## [0.1.0-beta.5] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Home can review 2–20 pasted public YouTube video or Short URLs, identify
  invalid and duplicate lines, and, when at least two items are ready,
  atomically admit all ready items under one durable, expandable queue parent.
  Child order, completed-sibling outcomes, and aggregate completion progress
  are preserved across failures and app restarts.
- VidStow keeps a bounded, owner-only history of sanitized terminal failures for
  Copy Diagnostics and Clear history. A separate explicit consent choice can
  send those allowlisted reports in the background; neither choice is
  preselected, and reports exclude video identities, links, paths, filenames,
  cookies, tokens, and error text.

### Changed

- The packaged application version is `0.1.0-beta.5`.
- Failed queue items show category-specific guidance and capability-backed next
  steps, including Start again for disk-space and folder-permission failures.
- The macOS window uses a light native title bar so its title remains legible
  above VidStow's light application shell.
- Migrated the engine dependency and package imports to the published
  `github.com/tejasa97/ytdlp-go v0.3.0` module path.

### Fixed

- Startup waits for the saved queue check instead of briefly reporting recovery,
  ignores stale workspace identities for terminal jobs, and clears a leftover
  recovery marker only when the committed state is provably intact.
- Completed queue rows no longer show stale transfer speed or time-remaining
  values and consistently report full progress.

## [0.1.0-beta.4] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- The packaged application version is `0.1.0-beta.4`.
- Action-required Review can try recovery again, retry with a fresh link, or
  discard saved data. Uncertain session evidence is not reused.
- Queue rows with pending or quarantined cleanup stay visible until that
  cleanup settles. Retry cleanup is available, and Remove appears only after
  cleanup is done.

### Fixed

- Deleting a file from Downloads also removes the matching completed item from
  the queue.
- Canceled rows that still carried a leftover cleanup phase show as Canceled
  and can be removed once cleanup has settled.

## [0.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- The packaged application version is `0.1.0-beta.3`.
- The desktop engine pin is `github.com/tejasa97/youtube_dlp v0.2.3`.
- Repeated downloads using the same YouTube player can reuse completed EJS
  preprocessing while each job retains its isolated JavaScript helper.

### Fixed

- Action-required queue rows provide a bounded review flow and can start over
  through normal analysis without deleting or reusing uncertain saved data.

## [0.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- README and release packaging recommend the
  [`vidstow/tap`](https://github.com/vidstow/homebrew-tap) Homebrew cask as the
  supported install path. The GitHub ZIP remains a checksum-pinned technical
  artifact.
- The packaged application version is `0.1.0-beta.2`.
- The desktop engine pin is `github.com/tejasa97/youtube_dlp v0.2.2`.

### Fixed

- Retrying a download that failed mid-transfer because its saved YouTube link
  expired no longer reuses the dead link forever: the first retry still
  resumes, and once a resume makes no progress (or the server rejects the link
  with HTTP 403) the next retry discards the saved data and restarts with a
  fresh link. After two such restarts the row explains that the item must be
  removed and downloaded again from Home.
- Mid-transfer failures now explain what Retry will do instead of surfacing
  the raw engine error.
- The macOS app icon uses Apple's 824/1024 icon grid with transparent
  padding so the Dock draws it at the same size as neighboring icons.

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Analysis and downloading of public, on-demand YouTube Shorts URLs.
- Automatic discovery of Homebrew FFmpeg and FFprobe when they are not on the
  application PATH.
- Initial desktop workflow for public single-video YouTube URLs.
- Analyze, quality presets, download queue, history, and FFmpeg diagnostics.
- Durable State v2 queue lifecycle, destination reservation, startup recovery,
  and bounded shutdown foundations.
- Backend-authored lifecycle queue controls and restored thumbnails.
- Packaged `ytdlp-js-helper` runtime for the macOS application bundle.
- Manual Apple-Silicon beta-candidate workflow with checksums, release
  metadata, and build-provenance attestation.

### Changed

- App icon, sidebar mark, and docs logos now use the simpler arrow-into-tray
  download glyph.
- The packaged application version is `0.1.0-beta.1`; no stable `0.1.0` release
  exists.
- Candidate packaging currently targets macOS on Apple Silicon only.
- Release automation creates a draft prerelease and cannot publish it.
- The desktop engine pin is `github.com/tejasa97/youtube_dlp v0.2.1`.
